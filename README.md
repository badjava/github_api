# GitHub API

This modules allows you to use the [KNPLabs php-github-api 1.x library](https://github.com/KnpLabs/php-github-api/tree/1.7) with a Drupal site.  Developers can build on this to integrate features from the github API v3 into their site.

Basic rules integration exists for performing some repo management tasks from within a Drupal site.

**Note:** The GitHub API token is stored in plain text in the database.
